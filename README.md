# 🔩 ReVanced Integrations  

ReVanced Extended Integrations containing classes to be merged by ReVanced Patcher.
This is for the purpose of facilitating the use of ReX with RVX builder, since now that both RVX and ReX are discontinued.

## ❓ How to use debugging:

- Usage on Windows: ```adb logcat | findstr "Extended" > log.txt```
- Usage on Linux: ```adb logcat | grep --line-buffered "Extended" > log.txt```
  
This will write the log to a file called log.txt which you can view then.
